| Lifespan Prediction | Compare predicted run-out dates with actual customer usage | Predictions within Â±5 days of actual depletion |
| Machine Learning | Track prediction accuracy improvement over 3 months | Demonstrable reduction in prediction error margin |
| Internet Data Mining | Verify web-crawled data against known product usage | 80%+ correlation between mined data and verified usage |

### 2. Payday Alignment Testing

| Test | Procedure | Success Criteria |
|------|-----------|------------------|
| Timing Accuracy | Verify email send times against known customer payday dates | Emails arrive 1-2 days after typical payday |
| Conversion Testing | A/B test payday-aligned vs. random timing emails | 20%+ higher conversion for payday-aligned emails |
| Payday Detection | Validate the system's ability to detect payday patterns | Correctly identify 80%+ of customer payday cycles |

### 3. Value Metrics Testing

| Test | Procedure | Success Criteria |
|------|-----------|------------------|
| Cost-Per-Day Accuracy | Manually verify calculations across product categories | 100% accuracy in cost-per-day calculations |
| Value Comparisons | Test comparison logic with controlled product sets | Consistent ranking of products by true value |
| Internet Enhancement | Compare value assessments with and without internet data | Measurable improvement in value assessment accuracy |
